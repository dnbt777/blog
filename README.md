## Meta Learning (Formerly Learn How to Learn)
<i color="#222">Meta learning is a positive feedback loop (exponential growth). The faster you learn **how to learn**, the faster you **learn** how to learn.

7 years ago I started focusing on meta learning once I saw it was a positive feedback loop, and only within the last few years have I seen meaningful compounding effects. This blog series contains articles on learning concepts/strategies to speed up your own positive feedback loop.</i>

## ML in Jax from Semi-Scratch
<i>
In this series I write about my journey to improve my ML skills by practicing implementing networks in jax.

Each post includes the resources I found helpful, useful tips, and my final code you can play around with.</i>
